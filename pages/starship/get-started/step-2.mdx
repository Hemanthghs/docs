# **Step 2:** Kubernetes Cluster

In this step, we will setup a Kubernetes cluster using `kind` or `Docker Desktop`.
Optionally if you have a Kubernetes cluster already, you can skip this step.

By the end of this tutorial you should be able to run `kubectl get nodes` and see a list of nodes.

Please **follow any one of the following** sections to setup a Kubernetes cluster.

## 2.1.1) Setup with Kind Cluster

### Prechecks
Make sure kind is installed
```bash
kind version
#
# kind v0.18.0 go1.20.2 linux/amd64
```

Make sure docker is running, and you have access to it.
```bash
docker ps
```

### Create kind cluster
Run
```bash
kind create cluster --name starship
```

Note: Kind will create an entry in the kubeconfig file and set the context to the new cluster.

Detailed Reference: https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#creating-a-cluster

## 2.1.2) Setup with Docker Desktop
Docker Desktop includes a standalone Kubernetes server and client, as well as Docker CLI integration that runs on your machine.

### Enable kubernetes
To enable Kubernetes in Docker Desktop:

* From the Docker Dashboard, select the Settings.
* Select **Kubernetes** from the left sidebar.
* Next to **Enable Kubernetes**, select the checkbox.
* Select **Apply & Restart** to save the settings and then click Install to confirm.

> Note: You might want to increase the memory and cpu allocated to the cluster, in Settings, Resources

### Connect with kubectl
```bash
# list of all the contexts
kubectl config get-contexts

# set the context to docker-desktop
kubectl config use-context docker-desktop
```

Detailed Reference: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/

## 2.2) Check Access to kubernetes

Kind will run a k8s cluster with docker. You can check the nodes with
```bash
kubectl get nodes
```
