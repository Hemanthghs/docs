# **Step 5:** All in one place

## TLDR
We have created some handy example directory for the tutorial you just went through.
You can find it at [examples/tutorial](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/starship/tree/main/examples/getting-started).
Directory structure is as follows
```bash
Makefile
configs/
  starship.yaml
  tiny-starship.yaml
scripts/
  dev-setup.sh
  port-forward.sh
README.md
```

Download the example directory with [URL](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcosmology-tech%2Fstarship%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fexamples%2Fgetting-started)

```bash
mkdir tldr-getting-started/

# copy the downloaded zip file to the directory
unzip ~/Downloads/cosmology-tech\ starship\ main\ examples-getting-started.zip -d tldr-getting-started/
```

Now you can run the commands from the example directory
```bash
cd tldr-getting-started/

# Install dependencies, install starship helm chart, create kind cluster
make clean setup

# Install the starship instance and run port-forward
make start
# OR, if you are low on resources on local machine
make start-tiny

# Stop the cluster with
make stop
```

Checkout the README.md for more details on the commands, you can even run the commands individually, if some commands are having trouble.

Once you are done, you can all the resources with
```bash
make clean
```
