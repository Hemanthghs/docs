# Starship Tests

Starship's setup for testing generated features on a virtual environment.

Starship tests can be found in: 'telescope/packages/starship'.

## Dependencies

### Dockers

Install and start docker, then check in the panel: "Settings -> Kubernetes" to make sure k8s’s enabled and running.

### Cluster tools

Install related cluster tools following the instruction [here](https://docs.cosmology.zone/starship/get-started/step-1):

- kind
- kubectl
- helm
- yq

## Start Starship

Go to the folder 'telescope/packages/starship'.

- Double check you do clean up before start, skip this if you're sure previous pods have been cleaned up:

```bash
make stop
```

```bash
# using kubectl get pods to know the status of running pods
kubectl get pods
#or keep watching by:
kubectl get pods -w
# wait for "No resources found in default namespace."
```

- With these two steps you’re ready to go:

1. To start pods
```bash
make install
```

```bash
# using kubectl get pods to know the status of running pods
kubectl get pods
#or keep watching by:
kubectl get pods -w
# wait for all listed pods running like:
# cosmos-2-genesis-0     3/3
# explorer-5575dc8774-kxs8v  1/1
# etc...
```

2. To open ports for access
```bash
make port-forward
```

## Generate Code

Setup scripts for generating code in the folder 'telescope/packages/starship/scripts/codegen.js'

Generate code using:
```bash
npm run codegen
```

Code'll be generated in the folder 'telescope/packages/starship/src/codegen'

## Test

```bash
# do tests, don't run all tests at the same time on your local machine:
# 1 setup:
npx jest __tests__/v1/setup.test.ts

# 2 authz:
npx jest __tests__/v1/authz.test.ts
```

## Stop the infra
When tests have finished, better stop the infra for starting successfully next time.
```bash
npm run e2e:stop
```
Which will
* Stop port-forwarding the traffic to your local
* Delete all the helm charts deployed

## Cleanup kind (optional)
If you are using kind for your kubernetes cluster, you can delete it with
```bash
npm run e2e:clean
```
