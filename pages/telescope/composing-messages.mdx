## Composing Messages

This example shows messages from the `osmojs`, which was built with Telescope.

Import the `osmosis` object from `osmojs`. In this case, we're show the messages available from the `osmosis.gamm.v1beta1` module:

```js
import { osmosis } from 'osmojs';

const {
    joinPool,
    exitPool,
    exitSwapExternAmountOut,
    exitSwapShareAmountIn,
    joinSwapExternAmountIn,
    joinSwapShareAmountOut,
    swapExactAmountIn,
    swapExactAmountOut
} = osmosis.gamm.v1beta1.MessageComposer.withTypeUrl;
```

Now you can construct messages. If you use vscode or another typescript-enabled IDE, you should also be able to use `ctrl+space` to see auto-completion of the fields required for the message.

```js
import { coin } from '@cosmjs/amino';

const msg = swapExactAmountIn({
  sender,
  routes,
  tokenIn: coin(amount, denom),
  tokenOutMinAmount
});
```
