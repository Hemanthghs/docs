## Code Structure

To make user better understand the whole design structure of CosmosKit, here to briefly introduce some important classes from `@cosmos-kit/core`.

There are four important classes.

- WalletManager
- MainWalletBase
- ChainWalletBase
- WalletRepo

Before all, we need to clarify that there are two types of entities in CosmosKit as a wallet adapter: **Chain** and **Wallet**. Chain is identified by chain name i.e. `cosmoshub`, `osmosis` etc. And wallet is identified by wallet name i.e. `keplr-extension`, `keplr-mobile`, `cosmostation-extension` etc.

> Note that we're taking a single wallet application as a wallet in CosmosKit rather than the wallet product name. Taking `Keplr` as an example, we diffientiate `extension` and `mobile` in our code because they are connected via totally different codes. So for product `Keplr`, we have two wallets `keplr-extension` and `keplr-mobile` in CosmosKit.

### WalletManager

`WalletManager` is the entrance of the whole code and it manages all `WalletRepo`, `MainWalletBase`, `ChainWalletBase` instances in it. It also corresponds to `ChainProvider` in `@cosmos-kit/react-lite` and `@cosmos-kit/react`. You can find that the properties of JSX element `ChainProvider` are almost the same with the constructor arguments of `WalletManager`. All necesssary chain information and wallet information from `ChainProvider` will be passed to corresponding wallet classes via `WalletManager`.

Three important properties/arguments in `ChainProvider`/`WalletManager` are `chains`, `assetLists` and `wallets`. `chains` and `assetLists` provide chain information, and `wallets` provides wallet information. Actually `wallets` is an array of `MainWalletBase` instances. Here leads to the second class `MainWalletBase`.

### MainWalletBase

`MainWalletBase` is meant to provide a base implementation and unified interface for all different wallets like `keplr-extension`, `keplr-mobile` and `cosmostation-extension`. Basically every wallet has it's own `MainWallet` class, which extends `MainWalletBase` in common, but with `WalletClient` implemented in different ways. In this way `WalletManager` can handle all different wallets no matter how different they're inside.

> For practice you can take a look at [How to Integrate New Wallets into CosmosKit](/integrating-wallets/adding-new-wallets)

`MainWalletBase` is only about wallet and it's not about any specifical chain. And it's responsible for initializing wallet client and managing all chain wallets. Here brings in the third class `ChainWalletBase`.

> So far `MainWalletBase` is dealing with four different broadcast/synchronization events for chain wallets.
>
> - broadcast_client
> - broadcast_env
> - sync_connect
> - sync_disconnect
>
> See details below.

### ChainWalletBase

When you're trying to connect to a wallet, you always need to provide a target chain name so that the wallet knows what to response. So `ChainWalletBase` is the class actually being used for real connection. It's the finest grain of functionality that with chain specified and also wallet specified.

We're separating `MainWalletBase` and `ChainWalletBase` because it's clearer to put some common properties like `wallet client` and `env` in the `MainWalletBase` to enable
centralized management and distribution (events `broadcast_client` and `broadcast_env`), and put only chain specified functionalities in `ChainWalletBase`.

Basically how many `chains` are provided in `ChainProvider` or `WalletManager`, how many `ChainWalletBase` instances will be constructed for a wallet. `ChainWalletBase` instances are independent with each other unless `sync` is set `true`. All the synchronization are also handled in `MainWalletBase` (events `sync_connect` and `sync_disconnect`).

### WalletRepo

We have a class `MainWalletBase` with wallet specified to manage all chain wallets. All these chain wallets are with the same wallet name but different chain name. Accordingly we also have another class `WalletRepo`, which with chain specified to manage all chain wallets that with the same chain name but different wallet name.

#### MainWalletBase vs. WalletRepo

Common:

- Both manage chain wallets

Differences:

| Class          | Indentifier | ChainWallets                                                                                                                    |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MainWalletBase | wallet name | `cosmoshub/keplr-extension`, `osmosis/keplr-extension`, `stargaze/keplr-extension`, `chihuahua/keplr-extension` etc.            |
| WalletRepo     | chain name  | `cosmoshub/keplr-extension`, `cosmoshub/keplr-mobile`, `cosmoshub/cosmostation-extension`, `cosmoshub/cosmostation-mobile` etc. |

`WalletRepo` provides a different perspective from chain side to consider all chain wallets in addition to `MainWalletBase`. It's useful in some dapps that chain is the key point rather than wallet.

So far `WalletRepo` is only used in [`WalletModal`](https://docs.cosmoskit.com/provider/chain-provider#walletmodal) properties.
